encryptedfile
=============

Write OpenPGP compatible-encrypted files like it ain't no thang.
Symmetric ciphers only.

-----
Usage
-----

Use it by itself::

    from encryptedfile.EncryptedFile import EncryptedFile
    f = EncryptedFile("hello.gpg", passphrase=getpass.getpass(),
                      encryption_algo=EncryptedFile.ALGO_AES256)
    f.write("super secret message")
    f.close()

Or with something passed through it::

    from encryptedfile.EncryptedFile import EncryptedFile
    import PIL
    img = ... # obtain image somehow
    f = EncryptedFile("pic.png.gpg", passphrase=getpass.getpass(),
                      encryption_algo=EncryptedFile.ALGO_BLOWFISH)
    img.save(f, "png")

Or use it in a `PEP-343 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/>`_
block::

    from encryptedfile import EncryptedFile
    with EncryptedFile("txt.gpg", passphrase=getpass.getpass()) as f:
         ... use f ...

-------
Decrypt
-------

Let's say we're using gpg::

    gpg filename

Supply the right passphrase, and tada!

FAQ
---

-  Do you support reading?

No, reading would mean supporting the bajillion ways that OpenPGP files
have been created throughout history. That would be a pain. I may at
some point in time support reading well enough to be able to read
whatever written by this module.
